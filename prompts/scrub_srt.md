# Prompt: review SRT suspects before burn-in

You are reviewing a Portuguese-language brand SRT that `06_build_srt.py`
generated from a word-level transcript. `06b_scrub_srt.py --agent-review`
has scanned that SRT and emitted a JSON document listing **suspects** —
cues that probably need a fix before `07_render_track.py` burns them
into the final MP4.

Your job: for each suspect, decide what to do, and apply the fix
directly to the SRT file via the file-edit tool your runtime gives you.
Then the pipeline can resume rendering.

## Input you receive

The script's stdout is the only input that matters. Schema:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "mode": "agent_review",
  "srt_path": "/Users/.../memory/messages/<slug>/srts/NN-<slug>.srt",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../memory/messages/<slug>/transcript.json",
  "prompt_path": "/Users/.../prompts/scrub_srt.md",
  "cut_index": 4,
  "cut": {
    "n": 4, "slug": "...", "start": 412.5, "end": 478.1,
    "theme": "...", "hook": "..."
  },
  "suspects": [
    {
      "cue": 13,
      "tc": "00:00:16,599",
      "text": "na E eu não digo",
      "pattern": "dropped_word_boundary",
      "matched": "na E",
      "rule_suggestion": "na. E eu não digo",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "context": {
        "prev_cue_text": "torna uma canseira",
        "next_cue_text": "isso só a respeito",
        "transcript_around_tc": "...canseira na alma. E eu não digo isso só..."
      },
      "applied": false
    }
  ],
  "applied_count": 0
}
```

## The four patterns and what each one usually means

### 1. `dropped_word_boundary`

A function word (em / que / de / para / com / …) sits directly before a
capitalized non-proper-noun. YouTube auto-captions ate a word at a
sentence boundary.

Examples seen in real dogfooding:

| SRT cue                 | What was actually said             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `do que Mas não`        | `do que nós. Mas não`              |
| `na E eu não digo`      | `na alma. E eu não digo`           |
| `superestimamos a Mas`  | `superestimamos a missão. Mas`     |
| `vem para uma Então`    | `vem para uma relação. Então`      |

**Use the `transcript_around_tc` field** — it shows the word-level
transcript around the cue's timestamp, which usually contains the
dropped word. The rule suggestion just inserts a period; you can
often do better by recovering the actual dropped word.

Confidence: 0.75 — *always* eyeball before applying.

### 2. `immediate_repetition`

`<word> <same word>` where the word is a known hesitation (a, o, um,
uma, que, eu, ele, ela, …). Speaker stuttered or YouTube duplicated.

Almost always: collapse to a single instance.

Confidence: 0.85.

### 3. `forbidden_ending`

A cue ends on a function word from `cut_validation.forbid_endings`
(porque, mas, que, para, com, de, em, e). Reads as a hanging thought.

The fix is **structural**, not textual: usually you want to move the
trailing word into the next cue. That mutates two cues at once, so the
rule engine doesn't auto-apply it.

Patterns that work:

- "trabalho com" + next cue "qualquer dia" → "trabalho" + "com qualquer dia"
- "porque" alone at cue end → merge with next cue

If both cues are short, prefer merging. If the current cue is full,
just shift the trailing function word.

Confidence: 0.60.

### 4. `dictionary`

Already applied automatically from
`memory/messages/<slug>/corrections.txt`. The suspect shows up in the
report with `applied: true` for transparency, no action needed.

## How to apply fixes

For each `suspect` with `applied: false`:

1. Read `srt_path` (full file) with your read-file tool.
2. Find the cue numbered `suspect.cue`.
3. Decide: accept the `rule_suggestion`, write a better one, or skip.
4. If accepting/editing: use the file-edit tool your runtime exposes to
   replace the exact `suspect.text` with your new text. Preserve the
   cue number and timestamp line.
5. For `forbidden_ending`: edit both the current and next cue
   together — usually move the trailing word.

Don't touch cues that aren't in the suspect list.

## When to skip a suspect

- The rule fired on a **stylistic repetition** the speaker meant
  emphatically: "Não, não!" or "lá, lá" — leave it. (The rule already
  skips comma-separated repetitions but slips through some.)
- The rule fired on a **proper noun** not yet in the whitelist:
  the suggestion would insert a period inside the name. Skip and tell
  the maintainer to add the name to `PROPER_NOUNS` in
  `06b_scrub_srt.py`.
- The cue text **already reads correctly**: the speaker really did
  pause mid-phrase, and the SRT captures that intentionally. Skip.

## After you're done

Once all suspects you accepted are applied, the pipeline can resume.
Either:

- The pipeline is paused waiting for you → tell the user "scrub done,
  ready to render" and run `pipeline.sh --render-cut N --slug <slug>
  --skip-scrub` (the `--skip-scrub` tells the orchestrator the SRT
  is already vetted).
- The pipeline was running standalone with `--use-llm` → no agent
  action needed; the LLM pass did this already.

Don't try to re-run `06b_scrub_srt.py` after applying fixes — the
suspects you addressed will disappear, but new ones may appear (e.g.,
a cue that now ends on "e" after you moved a "com"). Re-running is
fine but optional; one pass usually closes the loop.
