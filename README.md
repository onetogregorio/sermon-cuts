# Sermon Cuts

**English** · [Português](README.pt.md) · [Español](README.es.md)

> **Skill for Claude, Cursor, and other AI coding agents** that turns long
> preaching, sermon, or talk videos into ready-to-publish vertical clips for
> Reels, Shorts, and TikTok — already cropped, captioned, and audio-balanced.
> Paste a YouTube link. Pick your favorite moments. Get the cuts.

## What you get

You drop in a 30-, 40-, even 60-minute message — your sermon, your conference
talk, your livestream — and walk away with a folder of **vertical shorts ready
to upload**. Each one:

- Reframed vertically (1080×1920) with the speaker centered, smoothly
- Subtitled in your brand style — gold text, clean outline, no shouting caps
- Balanced to platform-standard loudness so it sounds right on Instagram and TikTok
- Named, numbered, and organized so you know what to post and when

What used to be a full Sunday-night editing session in CapCut becomes
**~5 minutes of curation**. You decide what to publish. The pipeline does the rest.

## Built for creators of the Word

Most short-form content tools are built for marketers selling shoes. This one
is built for **pastors, preachers, evangelists, teachers, content creators
talking about faith** — people whose message deserves better than a rushed
afternoon in Premiere.

It already knows:

- That a great cut needs a **hook**, a **development**, and a **conclusion** —
  not just a 60-second slice of someone talking
- That cuts can't end on "porque…" or "mas…" — they have to land
- That the subtitle font matters, that the audio level matters, that the
  centering of the speaker's face on a vertical frame matters
- That **you** are the one who picks the final cuts — the AI proposes, you decide

Made with portuguese-language sermons in mind, but works in any language
(`--language=en`, `pt`, `es`, etc).

## Use it as a skill in your AI editor

This whole pipeline is wrapped as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
skill — meaning you can just say to your AI assistant:

> *"cut this sermon: https://youtube.com/watch?v=…"*
> *"corta essa pregação"*
> *"make 8 vertical clips of this message for Instagram"*

…and the agent handles transcription, cut proposals, face tracking, subtitles,
audio normalization, and rendering. You only step in for the part that matters:
**choosing which moments of your message are worth publishing**.

Works the same way with **Cursor**, **Cline**, **Aider**, or any IDE/agent that
can read a `SKILL.md` and run shell scripts.

## Install — pick your path

### 🟢 Easiest: one command in any terminal

```bash
curl -fsSL https://onetogregorio.github.io/sermon-cuts/install.sh | bash
```

Detects your OS, installs ffmpeg/yt-dlp/Python, clones the repo, creates
a Python venv, symlinks the skill into `~/.claude/skills/sermon-cuts/`,
optionally configures Groq + Outfit, and runs a health check at the end.
**Re-runnable safely** — won't overwrite anything you already have.

### 🟡 Through your AI editor (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex…)

Paste this prompt into any AI editor with shell access:

> Install the **Sermon Cuts** skill (https://github.com/onetogregorio/sermon-cuts)
> on this machine. Walk me through these steps and stop if anything fails:
>
> 1. Detect my OS (macOS or Linux). On macOS, make sure Homebrew is installed.
> 2. Install system deps: `ffmpeg` (with libass), `yt-dlp`, Python 3.12+.
> 3. Clone the repo to `~/code/sermon-cuts` (or ask me where).
> 4. Create a Python venv inside the repo and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
> 5. Symlink `scripts/`, `config/`, `prompts/` into `~/.claude/skills/sermon-cuts/`
>    and copy `SKILL.md` there too.
> 6. Ask if I want to enable better transcription via Groq Whisper. If yes,
>    open https://console.groq.com/keys, ask me to paste the key, and add
>    `GROQ_API_KEY=...` to `~/.env`.
> 7. Ask if I want the brand font Outfit Black (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit).
>    If yes, download it and install to my user fonts folder.
> 8. Run `./scripts/pipeline.sh doctor` to confirm the skill is wired up.
> 9. Tell me a one-line example of how to cut my first sermon.
>
> Report success or the failed step at the end.

After install, just say *"cut this sermon: \<YouTube URL\>"* to the same agent.

### 🐳 Docker (Linux/Windows/no-pip)

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/out:/work/memory/messages" \
  -e GROQ_API_KEY=$GROQ_API_KEY \
  ghcr.io/onetogregorio/sermon-cuts <youtube-url>
```

> Build locally with `docker build -t sermon-cuts .` if you want to tweak the image.

## Daily workflow — the four commands you'll actually use

```bash
pipeline.sh doctor                              # health check (run this first)
pipeline.sh <url-or-mp4>                        # ingest + transcribe + propose cuts
pipeline.sh review <slug>                       # ↑↓ + SPACE + ENTER to pick + render
pipeline.sh ui                                  # open the web UI on localhost:7860
```

Or, for a no-terminal workflow:

```bash
pipeline.sh ui                                  # drag-drop, checkboxes, downloads
```

> 💡 **Don't have a Groq key?** Either let it auto-pick `--provider=local`
> (uses faster-whisper offline, no API key, ~1× realtime on Apple Silicon),
> or `--provider=youtube` (auto-captions, instant, slightly lower accuracy).

---

## Quick start (manual)

If you'd rather run it yourself:

```bash
# 1. Ingest + transcribe + find natural cut boundaries  (~1 min for a 30min sermon)
./scripts/pipeline.sh "https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZKeORvbgWpA"

# 2. Claude (or you) reads the transcript and proposes ~10 cuts.
#    A ranked list shows up; you pick which ones to render.

# 3. Render the cuts you approved  (~30–60s per cut on Apple Silicon)
./scripts/pipeline.sh --render-cuts 1,2,4,7 --slug my_sermon
```

Final cuts land in:

```
~/Movies/SermonCuts/renders/<slug>/01-cut_slug.mp4   # macOS
~/.local/share/sermon-cuts/renders/<slug>/...         # Linux
~/SermonCuts/renders/<slug>/...                       # other
```

(Override with `SERMON_CUTS_DATA_DIR=/your/path` to put everything elsewhere.)

Vertical 1080×1920, branded subtitles burned in, audio at -14 LUFS — ready to
upload to Reels, Shorts, or TikTok. See [`examples/sample_cuts/`](examples/sample_cuts/)
for a real output.

> First-time setup: see [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) — you need `ffmpeg`,
> Python deps, and a one-time symlink so the skill scripts resolve from
> `~/.claude/skills/sermon-cuts/`.

## What's inside

Each step is a standalone script — combine them however you like, or just run
`pipeline.sh` end-to-end.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `01_ingest.py` | YouTube URL or local video → managed source file |
| `02_transcribe.py` | Word-level transcription (free via YouTube, or premium via Groq Whisper) |
| `03_vad_segments.py` | Finds natural pauses so cuts never split mid-word |
| `04_propose_cuts.py` | Packages the message for the AI to propose narrative-arc cuts |
| `05_validate_cut.py` | Auto-fixes cuts that end mid-thought |
| `06_build_srt.py` | Brand-style subtitles: 3-4 words, gold, sentence case |
| `07_render_track.py` | Face-tracking vertical reframe + burned subtitle |
| `08_audio_normalize.py` | Audio balanced to -14 LUFS (the Reels/TikTok standard) |
| `pipeline.sh` | One command to run it all |

## Install

```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp python@3.12
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Linux instructions and optional Groq API setup in [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).)

---

## Make it look like yours

Three ways to brand subtitles, from quickest to most thorough:

```bash
# 1. Per render — CLI override (try a different font without editing anything):
./scripts/07_render_track.py my_sermon 1 --preset helvetica-bold

# 2. Per sermon — drop a style.yaml in the sermon's working dir:
echo "preset: outfit-black" > memory/messages/my_sermon/style.yaml
# Or hand-tune the full ASS string:
echo "force_style: 'FontName=Custom,FontSize=18,Outline=1.2,Alignment=2,MarginV=80'" \
  >> memory/messages/my_sermon/style.yaml

# 3. Global default — change for every render going forward:
# edit config/render_defaults.yaml -> subtitle.preset
```

Built-in presets: `arial-black` (default, ships everywhere), `helvetica-bold`
(macOS-native, lighter), `outfit-black` (requires installing the Outfit font).
Add your own in `config/style_presets/<your-name>.txt`. Full palette + brand
guide in [STYLE.md](docs/STYLE.md).

## About me

Hi, I'm **Neto Gregório** — I build tools at the intersection of faith,
creativity, and AI. I made Sermon Cuts because I was tired of spending Sunday
night cutting my own messages into Reels by hand, and I figured other people
preaching, teaching, and creating spiritual content might be tired of it too.

If this project saves you an evening, I'd love to hear about it.
